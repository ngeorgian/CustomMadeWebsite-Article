<h1> How Social Media Affects Public Opinion </h1>
<h2> Written by Nick Georgian </h2>

<p> Social media has become a powerful tool for swaying public opinions and changing the way people think. What people often forget is how the media 
“functions as a window to the outside world, what appears across its landscape actually may become people’s reality. Thus, the potential for distorting their view of that world 
is high if the picture provided is unrepresentative of actual events” – (Anastasio). Two ways in which social media can change the perspective of the public is through fake news 
and online commenting.</p>

<hr /> <h3 align="center"> Fake News </h3>

<p>Fake news has grown substantially in occurrence over the past year. The fake news industry has gotten so popular that even major news stations such as Fox news 
have had to apologize for reporting stories based on fake articles. The rise of fake news is largely due to social media. Social media has become many American’s main source of news 
with a study confirming “that 62 percent of American adults get their news from social media, with Facebook leading the way by far. Nearly two-thirds of its users get news from the 
platform” - (Chang, Lefferman, Pedersen, Martz). This means that the majority of adults obtain their news by clicking on and sharing links they enjoy. This allows for fake news to 
be as easily accessible as real news. <br /></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651537/what-is-fake-news--main_thumb800.jpg" 
align="left" hspace="25"/> What gives fake news the advantage is how the headlines are made to be shocking and interesting. For example, one of the writers of an online 
news website called Nightline showed an ABC news interviewer how he took a real news article title, “Rush Reveals Michelle’s Past”, and modified it to be “Rush Reveals Michelle’s 
Perverted Past After She Dumps on Trump” (Chang, Lefferman, Pedersen, Martz) so that people would click on the link to read the article (in which he gets paid for every click). Due 
to this situation, fake stories are shared more often than real news stories. Buzzfeed performed a study where they “looked at the top 20 fake news stories about the election and 
compared them to the top 20 election stories from 19 major media outlets, the fake news ones got more engagement on Facebook” - (Chang, Lefferman, Pedersen, Martz). The study 
concluded how fake news is dominating real news.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/wyjyo.jpg" align="right" width="375" height="350" hspace="5"/>This leads to the central problem of fake news: people are choosing to accept false information due to it pertaining to their beliefs. No matter what your opinion is, it is nice 
to see other people expressing the same opinion as your own. Using this idea to their advantage, fake news sites thrive by “portraying a world in which people’s opinions are based 
on their ethnic or demographic group membership” which can lead to “subtly but powerfully [creating] the very opinions they seek to reflect” – (Anastasio). This idea is stemmed from
 what makes social media so powerful. It has become a central part of millions of lives and it is changing how we think on a daily basis. Even the creator of Buzzfeed, which is a 
 company that thrives off the social media outlet, recognizes that “our social media feed, designed to mirror our own opinions, confirms our biases. So when you give a customer what
 they want, they end up drowning in it, to the exclusion of anything else” – (Chang, Lefferman, Pedersen, Martz). This exclusion of other opinions is dangerous, for it not only 
 convinces us that our ideas of the world are right, but it also enforces us to think that opinions that are different from our own are wrong. <hr /></p>
 
 <h3 align="center"> Online Comments </h3>
 
<p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YbJhPVI.png" align="left" hspace="25" width="450" height="300" /> Comments have become a major way in which people communicate. Between Twitter, Facebook post, and other 
applications, people can see millions of opinions on practically any topic. When opinions are posted on social media, it can sway the opinions of those who read them. For example, 
an experiment was performed to see if a neutral video would sway the participants’ opinion of McDonalds. The idea was to measure how “online comments could sometimes help users to 
solidify their original attitudes toward, change their perspectives on, and even influence their willingness to speak out online about an issue, particularly when they perceive 
that others' comments align with their own attitudes toward the issue/organization. By the same token, some may stay silent if they perceive others’ comments are against their own

previously held opinions” – (Lee, Chun). After the video, participants were shown comments that others had pertaining to the content. The experiment “found that the effects of 
online comments and public opinion polls interact with individuals' prior attitudes toward a corporation. The latitude of acceptance toward online comments and participants' 
willingness to speak out online increased as the comments themselves became negative only among people with negative prior attitudes. However, the change was not detected among 
people with positive prior attitudes” – (Lee, Chun). In other words, the experiment concluded that negative attitudes are fueled by negative comments while positive attitudes 
are unmoved by any comments. This experiment represents how powerful commenting can be; it can make a person more opposed to something simply because others are also opposed to it.
 This causes social media to become a culture based on negativity. </p>

 The Sewol ferry disaster in Korea exemplifies how social media can sway the public’s negativity. “On 16 April 2014, the ferry Sewol, which was carrying 476 people including 
 325 high school students on a school trip, capsized and sank off the southwestern coast of South Korea. This disaster left more than 300 people dead, injured, or missing” - 
 (Woo, Cho, Shim, Lee, Song). This accident led to a shocked Korea. Once the story got out about what happened, it “elicited immediate emotional reactions from the public, 
 including anger directed at various social and political events occurring in the aftermath of the disaster” - (Woo, Cho, Shim, Lee, Song). What’s interesting about this 
 situation is that the majority of the Korean public was affected by the event. This shows how “people who are not directly involved in a disaster may nonetheless be affected by 
 it through various channels, such as repeated news reports on the disaster on television or other media” - (Woo, Cho, Shim, Lee, Song). With news so easily accessible, tragic 
 events can cause an entire nation to enter mourning within hours. This means that when disasters occur in small areas of the world, “everyone in society may be vulnerable to such 
 events” - (Woo, Cho, Shim, Lee, Song). <hr /></p>
 
 <h3 align="center"> Conclusion </h3>

 Social media is a great tool and has already done many good things; it keeps people updated on the lives of others, it makes mass communication easy and efficient, and it
 can be loads of fun. What is important to remember is how easily content can change our perspective of the world. Between fake news and online comments, it is sometimes 
 difficult to remember that these are real people and real events being discussed. The moral of the story is to be cautious about how others affect you and to have your own
 opinion.</p>
