# CustomMadeWebsite-Article
Instead of simply writing a paper, I decided to make my essay into a website. Using online resources such as tutorials from thenewboston, I created a custom website using html and css. 
Since I don't have an account for a database, it is not actually on the web. To view it in webstie form, copy the html/css code into a program such as notepad++, then save the file as an html file (there is a drop down menu below the file name where you can select the type of file). Then, when you double click on the file, it will pop up in your browser as a normal website.
